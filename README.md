uni-latex-template
==================

LaTeX templates and other junk I use for uni

# Components
### Homework
Template for homework, has a question, an answer and a fancy title page.

### LectureNotes
Individual lectures are put in individual files and can be turned into a pdf with a single lecture. A bundle of lectures can also be built, as seen in `full.tex`

### WrittenAssignment
**TODO** --- It's fancy

### `bin/build-hatt-template.py`
Builds a truth table using [beastaugh/hatt](https://github.com/beastaugh/hatt)

TODO: Update script to use [adamchalmers/caroll](https://github.com/adamchalmers/carroll)
